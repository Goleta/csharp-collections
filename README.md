#C# Collections

Goletas.Collections is a set of data structures engineered for optimal performance.

##System Requirements
* Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 is required to compile the source code.

##What’s Included?

* SortedSet<T> - This is the first and only iterative implementation of AVL trees in C# available to date. Balanced binary tree nodes contain parent pointers to completely eliminate stack dependency on traversals and help more efficiently rebalance the tree.
* SortedDictionary<K,V> - Implementation of a dictionary based on the SortedSet<T> algorithms.
* LinkedStack<T> - Stack implementation that uses singly linked list nodes.
* LinkedQueue<T> - Queue implementation that uses singly linked list nodes.
